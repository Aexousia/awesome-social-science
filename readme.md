## Aphorisms / Adages / Epigrams

#### [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)

> Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected

For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number
of possible and more complex alternatives, but simpler theories are more preferable
because they are easily testable. This is a line of reasoning often used in daily life.

#### [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)

> Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.

A special case of Occam's razor, the history of this aphorism is controversial,
but the applications are endless. [Miscommunications are often attributed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/48#issuecomment-118540912)
to this aphorism in Open Source Projects.

#### [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law)

> If anything can go wrong -- it will.

People most often relate with `If there is a worse time for something to go wrong,
it will happen then.`, especially after the dawn of mobile communication (no coverage
right when you need it most) and the Internet (no connectivity, when you have to send
that one life-changing email.)

#### [Godwin's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law)

> As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1

In many newsgroups, it is a tradition in which whoever mentions the Nazis automatically
loses the debate that was going on, and the thread if finished there and then. Also, popularly
referred to as `Playing the Hitler card`.

## Psychological Syndromes

#### [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)

> When the victim mistakes a lack of abuse as an act of kindness by the captor.

Traumatic bonding that is most common in kidnapping situations, where the hostages
express sympathy towards the captor, to the point of defending the captors. It may be
attributed to the natural selection process that let our hunter-gatherer ancestors
solve adaptive problems.

#### [Pygmalion effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect)

> the phenomenon whereby higher expectations lead to an increase in performance

The idea behind this effect is that if a leader expects more of a follower, then the follower tends to
improve their performance. Studies of this effect in action are hard to conduct because they are generally
in an artificial, manipulated setting. Also, there is an argument that often the perception of a follower
by the leader directly or indirectly affect the expectations that said leader has from the follower. This
effect was shown to exist in schools in the Rosenthal-Jacobson study.
