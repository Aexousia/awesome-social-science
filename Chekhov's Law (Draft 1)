Chekhov's Law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun)

>If an element is present in the story, it should contribue to it.

> Known by the famous anecdote "If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall,in the second or 
  third chapter it must absolutely go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there."
> The term has come to mean "an insignificant object that later turns out to be important."
> Chekhov's advice was not necessarily to conceal importance, but to just not spend time on things that are not important.
> In practicality, Chekhov's Law is used in carefully written shows and books where audience keep obsessing over minuscule 
  details and looking out for Chekhov's Guns everywhere. This keeps the intrest captured.
